# coastal_topobathy

Team project aimed at extracting sections of tracklines, and identifying bathymetry and coastal morphology

## How to contribute

* Use our Slack channel ICESat2 - Coastal or GitHub issues to suggest new things we might work on or changes to our repo. 
* Use the `contributors` directory to add notebooks or try out ideas. You can use the `examples` notebooks as templates.
* Add an issue if you make a function or notebook that you think would be good to incorporate into `coastal` or `examples` but don't want to do that yourself.
* `coastal` Here we have functions that can be used across our examples. Please add a documentation header to your functions. See existing functions for examples. We are using the [numpy documentation style guide](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html)
* `examples` Here we have notebooks that work fully through an example.
* `docs` This is the code that used to generate the landing page https://icesat-2hackweek.github.io/coastal_topobathy/. If you want to update a page to the docs it goes here. You can also post an issue with the suggested change/addition, if you don't want to go into `docs` yourself.
